# OpacusBiodesign

This repository stores:
* *R. opacus* transcript and flux data
* Jupyter notebooks for processing of data and T2F model creation


About **Biodesign T2F**:

Biodesign T2F aims to build the first comprehensive computational model of *R. opacus*, a gram-positive bacterium, that converts genome scale transcript measurements to genome scale fluxes.

We are using a three pronged approach, aimed at measuring metabolic fluxes indirectly using heuristic and mechanistic models, machine learning models, and probabilistic programming that integrates prior biological knowledge of metabolic stoichiometry.
